                In today's digital era, web programming proficiency is essential for aspiring developers. To meet the escalating demand, educators and researchers are crafting effective learning environments. This literature review unveils pivotal insights, driving the creation of Web Block Craft, an innovative platform tailored for novice web programmers. Challenges in integrating web technologies into curricula inspire Web Block Craft's standalone, interactive approach, while success with Blockly-based education underscores its focus on computational thinking. Emphasizing accessible learning experiences, the platform's integration of visual blocks aligns with advocacy for playful introductions to programming.

            <p class="gap-text1">Efforts to simplify web development resonate with Web Block Craft's mission to enhance understanding and application of HTML and CSS. Similarly, a dual-mode coding approach influences the platform's flexibility, fostering a user-friendly environment. LearnJS and Google Blockly-JavaScript fusion offer structured learning and reactive system development insights, respectively. Conversely, Web Block Craft focuses on foundational web programming skills, employing custom Blockly blocks for JavaScript and DOM manipulation education. Insights into error reduction strategies and practical backend functionalities enrich its educational content and real-world applicability.</p>

                    Despite the increasing importance of web programming skills, there exists a gap in educational tools that effectively introduce children aged eleven and above, as well as beginners, to interactive and enjoyable web development experiences. While coding skills are crucial in today's digital economy, traditional code editors often present complexities that hinder effective learning, especially for novices. Existing educational platforms may lack the intuitive and visually driven approach necessary to engage younger learners and beginners effectively. Moreover, there is a scarcity of comprehensive learning tools that cover both frontend and backend web development, including key concepts such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, server creation, web app security, APIs, and database handling.

                  <p class="gap-text1">
                    Current educational resources may not adequately address the need for structured learning experiences with step-by-step guides tailored for beginners. Furthermore, there is a gap in integrating custom blocks specifically designed for web programming concepts within a flexible framework, such as Google Blockly. These custom blocks could enhance the practical understanding of both frontend and backend development, enabling users to transition seamlessly from visual representation to code implementation.
                  </p>

                  <p class="gap-text1">
                    The research gap identified underscores the need for an innovative educational application like Web Block Craft, which leverages the Google Blockly framework to provide a holistic learning environment for web programming. By addressing these gaps, Web Block Craft aims to empower users to develop web projects with confidence and creativity, bridging the digital divide and equipping the younger generation with essential coding skills for the future.
