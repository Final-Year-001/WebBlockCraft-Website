              In today's digital era, web programming proficiency is essential
              for aspiring developers. To meet the escalating demand, educators
              and researchers are crafting effective learning environments. This
              literature review unveils pivotal insights, driving the creation
              of Web Block Craft, an innovative platform tailored for novice web
              programmers. Challenges in integrating web technologies into
              curricula inspire Web Block Craft's standalone, interactive
              approach, while success with Blockly-based education underscores
              its focus on computational thinking. Emphasizing accessible
              learning experiences, the platform's integration of visual blocks
              aligns with advocacy for playful introductions to programming.

            Efforts to simplify web development resonate with Web Block Craft's
            mission to enhance understanding and application of HTML and CSS.
            Similarly, a dual-mode coding approach influences the platform's
            flexibility, fostering a user-friendly environment. LearnJS and
            Google Blockly-JavaScript fusion offer structured learning and
            reactive system development insights, respectively. Conversely, Web
            Block Craft focuses on foundational web programming skills,
            employing custom Blockly blocks for JavaScript and DOM manipulation
            education. Insights into error reduction strategies and practical
            backend functionalities enrich its educational content and
            real-world applicability.

                Despite the increasing importance of web programming skills,
                there exists a gap in educational tools that effectively
                introduce children aged eleven and above, as well as beginners,
                to interactive and enjoyable web development experiences. While
                coding skills are crucial in today's digital economy,
                traditional code editors often present complexities that hinder
                effective learning, especially for novices. Existing educational
                platforms may lack the intuitive and visually driven approach
                necessary to engage younger learners and beginners effectively.
                Moreover, there is a scarcity of comprehensive learning tools
                that cover both frontend and backend web development, including
                key concepts such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation,
                server creation, web app security, APIs, and database handling.

                integrating custom blocks specifically designed for web
                programming concepts within a flexible framework, such as Google
                Blockly. These custom blocks could enhance the practical
                understanding of both frontend and backend development, enabling
                users to transition seamlessly from visual representation to
                code implementation.
